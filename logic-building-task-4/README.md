# Feb Internship – Functions with Loops (Task 4)
## Overview

This repository contains solutions for Task 4: Functions with Loops as part of the February 2026 Data Science Internship program.

The objective of this assignment is to strengthen logical thinking and apply Python functions with loops to solve real-world scenarios such as validation systems, eligibility checks, fare calculations, and security verification.

## Problems Covered
🔹 Problem 1: Mobile Recharge Validation System

Validates recharge amount based on predefined plan rules and minimum recharge conditions.
Uses a function and while loop to allow retry until valid input is provided.

🔹 Problem 2: Inventory Reorder Alert System

Checks stock levels and generates reorder alerts if stock falls below a threshold.
Uses dictionary iteration with a for loop.

🔹 Problem 3: Student Result Processing System

Calculates average marks and determines pass or fail status.
Uses loop-based total calculation and returns result from function.

🔹 Problem 4: Cab Fare Estimator with Retry Option

Calculates fare based on base fare, per kilometer rate, and peak hour charges.
Uses function for fare calculation and while loop for retry logic.

🔹 Problem 5: Employee Attendance Eligibility Checker

Computes attendance percentage and determines eligibility based on 75% rule.
Uses loop to count present days and returns eligibility status.

🔹 Problem 6: Password Strength Checker

Validates password strength based on minimum length, digit presence, and special character requirement.
Uses loop over string and conditional checks.

## Learning Outcomes

Practical implementation of Python functions

Effective use of for and while loops

Input validation techniques

Real-world logical problem solving

Clean and structured code writing

## Conclusion

This task enhanced my understanding of function-based programming and loop control structures.
It improved my ability to design modular, reusable, and logically structured Python programs for real-world applications.
