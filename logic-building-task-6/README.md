# Feb Internship – Task 6: Function-Based Problem Solving
## Overview

This repository contains solutions for Task 6: Function-Based Problem Solving as part of the February 2026 Data Science Internship.

The objective of this task is to design real-world system-based solutions using Python functions, loops, conditional logic, and data structures.

## Problems Implemented

1.Smart Parking Lot Management System

2.Online Food Delivery Time Estimator

3.Movie Theatre Seat Occupancy Analyzer

4.Cloud Server Load Classification System

5.Smart Classroom Resource Usage Monitor

6.Online Event Registration Capacity Controller

Each problem simulates a real-time industry use case such as smart city systems, logistics platforms, cloud monitoring, and event management.

## Key Concepts Applied

Function-based modular programming

Loop-based data processing

Conditional decision making

Capacity validation logic

Percentage and average calculations

Real-world alert systems

## Learning Outcome

This task strengthened my ability to design structured, modular, and real-time system simulations using Python. It improved my logical thinking and function-based problem-solving approach.
